    "culture": "The culture of Thiruvananthapuram is a rich tapestry woven from tradition, art, festivals, literature, and a deep spiritual heritage. The city is often considered the cultural capital of Kerala, and for good reason. The city's cultural identity is deeply influenced by Hindu temples, most notably the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, one of the richest and oldest temples in the world. It is a masterpiece of Dravidian architecture and holds immense significance in the Vaishnavite tradition. The region also respects secularism, with prominent churches, mosques, and religious sites coexisting peacefully. The Vettucaud Church, Palayam Mosque, and Beemapally Dargah are important centers of faith for Christians and Muslims. Thiruvananthapuram has long been a cradle for classical music and dance. The city is famous for its patronage of Carnatic music, Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, and Koodiyattam, a 2000-year-old Sanskrit theatre form recognized by UNESCO. The legendary music composer Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma, a former king of Travancore, played a key role in developing classical music and dance in the region. Institutions like the Swathi Thirunal College of Music and Kalabhavan Theatre continue to uphold these traditions. The cultural calendar of Thiruvananthapuram is marked by vibrant festivals such as Onam, Navaratri Music Festival, Attukal Pongala, Nishagandhi Dance Festival, Christmas, and Easter. The city has produced and nurtured many famous writers, poets, and filmmakers, and hosts the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), one of the most prestigious film festivals in Asia. The architecture of Thiruvananthapuram reflects its royal past under the Kingdom of Travancore, with palaces like Kuthira Malika and Kanakakkunnu Palace showcasing traditional Kerala architecture. The cityscape combines colonial-era buildings, modern structures, and lush greenery, offering a unique urban charm.",
